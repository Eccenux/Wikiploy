/**
	Bot with edit&create rights.
	
	You can create the bot account on any wiki. E.g. on the test wiki:
	https://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BotPasswords

	The username will be something like `MyName@Wikiploy` where `Wikiploy` would be a bot name
	(you can choose any bot name but "Wikiploy" would be a good choice to separate it from other things).
	
	The password will be something like `12345abcdefpqrst123456abcdef`.
