Wikiploy
==========================

User scripts and gadgets deployment for wikis (Wikipedia or more generally MediaWiki based wiki).
Rollout your JS, CSS etc from your git repository to as many MW wikis as you need.

This is using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to control [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/). You just open Chrome and run a script. The idea is that you are logged in in Chrome and so all edits are still your edits. You can keep the Canary running in the background when you are changing and deploying more stuff.
